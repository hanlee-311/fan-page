     <h1 class="StyledFont">Bio</h1>

     <p class="ParagraphFont">Park Jae-sang, known proffesionally as PSY, is a South Korean singer, rapper, song writer, and record producer. Born to an affluent family in the Gangnam District of Seoul, South Korea, Park Jae-sang would find inspiration from his youth for the content and style of his music. </p>

     <p class="ParagraphFont">Probably best known for his international hit "Gangnam Style", PSY is also known for his comical music. His "Gangnam Style" broke Youtube records that astounded Youtube, making it the first video to reach a billion views on the website. Although he was written more music since then, "Gangnam Style" still remains his optimus maximus.</p>
       
      <p class="ParagraphFont">Growing up, PSY was known as the "class clown" and was not a fan of school. As it would happen, his teachers were not a big fan of him back then either, as he often made "sex jokes" and would derail the attention of his class. However, as one of his teachers has stated, "Looking back, I see he added a great energy to the class."</p>
